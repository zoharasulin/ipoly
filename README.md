# ipoly

## Project description

### What is it ?

**ipoly** is a Python package that provides features that Data Scientist may need that aims to simplify the development thanks to functions using polymorphic inputs.
### Main features

Here are just a few of the things that **ipoly** can do:
- Send emails easily
- Load most types of file with a unique function looking recursively for the file
- Save most types of file with a unique function
- Update a DataFrame with new data easily
- Generate a .tex or .pdf easily using only Python
- Prepare automatically a DataFrame for ML (filling missing data, dropping too much correlated features ...)

## Where to get it
